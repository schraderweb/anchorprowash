    <h3>Benzonia Culture</h3>

    <p>Kalkaska (/kælˈkæskə/ kal-KASS-kə) is a village in the U.S. state of Michigan. Kalkaska is the county seat and only incorporated community of Kalkaska County, 
and is considered part of Northern Michigan. Its population was 2,132 at the 2020 census, an increase from 2,020 at the 2010 census.

Kalkaska is part of the Traverse City micropolitan area, and is often considered a bedroom community of nearby Traverse City. 
The town is also renowned for hosting the National Trout Festival, with the first festivities being held in 1935. </p>

    <br /><br />



    <p>The land on which Kalkaska sits has long been territory under the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi.

In 1872, Albert A. Abbott arrived on the land set to become the village from his hometown of Decatur. The following year, on May 12, 
Abbott platted his land and became its first postmaster. In 1874, Kalkaska became a station on a new Pennsylvania Railroad line 
from Walton to Petoskey. Today, this line is part of the Great Lakes Central Railroad.

          <br /><br />

Tourists are attracted to the area to visit the surrounding lakes (including Torch Lake) and rivers such as the Jordan River, Rapid River, 
and Manistee River. Kalkaska offers two major festivals, the National Trout Festival held at the end of April to honor the opening of trout 
season, and the Kalkaska County Agricultural Fair, held the first week of August, to showcase local livestock from 4-H youth clubs and 
handicrafts from residents. The Kalkaska WinterFest held in January features dogsled races. Fall foliage color tours are also popular with visitors. </p>
